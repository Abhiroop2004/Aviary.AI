2. **PDF Data Extraction**: Extracts bird-related data from PDFs using `PyPDF2`.
3. **Text Chunking**: Splits large texts into manageable chunks.
4. **Vectorstore Setup**: Converts text chunks into embeddings and stores them in a FAISS vector store.
5. **UI**: The user interface is built with Streamlit to provide an easy search experience for users.
6. **Prompting**: Creates dynamic prompts to generate concise, factual responses.
7. **User Interaction**: Handles user queries, and integrates custom data and Wikipedia to generate responses.

Key UI functionalities:
- **Search Bar**: Users can input a bird's name.
- **Search Button**: Initiates the search and generates results.
- **Results Display**: Displays detailed information about the queried bird, including scientific name, habitat, diet, lifespan, and more.

### Key Elements of the UI:
- **Prompt Template**: The chatbot is guided by a prompt template that ensures it delivers the necessary bird information in a structured format.
- **Streamlit Layout**: A sleek, dark-themed layout for easy navigation.

## Note

- Generate your Gemini API Key from <https://aistudio.google.com/apikey> and add it to `.env` file.
- 2 PDF sources in `\Data` were too large and hence couldn't be uploaded to GitHub, you can search them on Google with the terms Illustrated Encyclopedia of Birds - DK and Encyclopedia of birds - International Masters Publishing 2007 and add them to `\Data` path.
